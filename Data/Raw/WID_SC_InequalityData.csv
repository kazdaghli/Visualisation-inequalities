Variable Description;.;.;.;Average Fiscal income within a given percentile group. Fiscal income is defined as the sum of all income items reported on income tax returns, before any deduction. It includes labour income, capital income and mixed income. The concept of fiscal income varies with national tax legislations, so in order to make international comparisons it is preferable to use the concept of national income. The population is comprised of individuals over age 20. The base unit is the individual (rather than the household). This is equivalent to assuming no sharing of resources within couples.;Average Fiscal income within a given percentile group.

The concept of fiscal income varies with national tax legislations, so in order to make international comparisons it is preferable to use the concept of national income. The population is comprised of individuals over age 20. The base unit is the tax unit defined by national fiscal administrations to measure personal income taxes.;Average Pre-tax national income within a given percentile group. Pre-tax national income  is the sum of all pre-tax personal income flows accruing to the owners of the production factors, labor and capital, before taking into account the operation of the tax/transfer system, but after taking into account the operation of pension system. The central difference between personal factor income and pre-tax income is the treatment of pensions, which are counted on a contribution basis by factor income and on a distribution basis by pre-tax income. The population is comprised of individuals over age 20. The base unit is the individual (rather than the household). This is equivalent to assuming no sharing of resources within couples.;Average Pre-tax national income within a given percentile group.

The population is comprised of individuals over age 20. The base unit is the tax unit defined by national fiscal administrations to measure personal income taxes.;The beta coefficient corresponds to the inverted Pareto-Lorenz coefficient. It is equal to mean income over percentile <percentile>. A coefficient b=2=200% for an income level 100 000 EUR means that the average income above 100 000 EUR is 200 000 EUR, a coefficient of 3 or 300% at income level 1 000 000 EUR means that the average income level above 1 000 000 EUR in a given population is 3 000 000 EUR.;The beta coefficient corresponds to the inverted Pareto-Lorenz coefficient.
