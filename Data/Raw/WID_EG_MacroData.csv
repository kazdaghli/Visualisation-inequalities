Variable Description;.;.;.;Average Consumption of fixed capital of national economy. Consumption of fixed capital of national economy is the decline in total value of fixed assets (e.g. roads, machines) which are owned and used by a producer. In other words, the amounts required to maintain the quality of fixed assets from a year to another. The decline in  value is a result of physical deterioration, normal obsolescence or normal accidental damage.The national economy - in the national accounts sense - includes all domestic sectors, i.e. all entities that are resident of a given country (in the sense of their economic activity), whether they belong to the private sector, the corporate sector, the governement sector.

The population is comprised of individuals of all ages.;Average National income. National income aims to measure the total income available to the residents of a given country. It is equal to the gross domestic product (the total value of goods and services produced on the territory of a given country during a given year), minus fixed capital used in production processes (e.g. replacement of obsolete machines or maintenance of roads) plus the net foreign income earned by residents in the rest of the world.// National income has many limitations, however it is the only income concept that has an internationally agreed definition (established by the United Nations System of National Accounts, see SNA 2008). We thus use it as our reference concept (after corrections to include income hidden in tax havens). // The national economy - in the national accounts sense - includes all domestic sectors, i.e. all entities that are resident of a given country (in the sense of their economic activity), whether they belong to the private sector, the corporate sector, the governement sector.
