Variable Description;.;.;.;Average Consumption of fixed capital of national economy. Consumption of fixed capital of national economy is the decline in total value of fixed assets (e.g. roads, machines) which are owned and used by a producer. In other words, the amounts required to maintain the quality of fixed assets from a year to another. The decline in  value is a result of physical deterioration, normal obsolescence or normal accidental damage.The national economy - in the national accounts sense - includes all domestic sectors, i.e. all entities that are resident of a given country (in the sense of their economic activity), whether they belong to the private sector, the corporate sector, the governement sector.
